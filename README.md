<b>ScaRX</b> is an android application.It can scan QR code(2D) or Bar Code(1D) both.
<br>
I made this application using XML(frontend), Java(backend) and ZXing library.<br>
In backend part,it has 3 main body -> MainActivity.java(starting page with progress bar), HomeActivity.java(Welcome page) and built-in CaptureActivity.class of ZXing library.
